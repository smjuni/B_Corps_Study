# B Corporations
Analyzing B_corps business data from B-labs

## Scope of Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is a personal project created so I can explore, learn about and access BCorporation data.

The aim is to explore similarities between industries and business size as well as longitudinal data to confirm increase in bcorp certifications year over year.

The three questions I wish to address are:
1. What business size are most likely to become BCorps Certified?
2. What trends can be seen by industries/categories becoming certified over the years?
3. 

## Tools Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Sci-Kit Learn - Unsupervised Learning 
- Tableau

## What is a B Corp?

<i> "Certified B Corporations are businesses that meet the highest standards of verified social and environmental performance, public transparency, and legal accountability to balance profit and purpose. B Corps are accelerating a global culture shift to redefine success in business and build a more inclusive and sustainable economy.

Societyâ€™s most challenging problems cannot be solved by government and nonprofits alone. The B Corp community works toward reduced inequality, lower levels of poverty, a healthier environment, stronger communities, and the creation of more high quality jobs with dignity and purpose. By harnessing the power of business, B Corps use profits and growth as a means to a greater end: positive impact for their employees, communities, and the environment.

B Corps form a community of leaders and drive a global movement of people using business as a force for good. The values and aspirations of the B Corp community are embedded in the B Corp Declaration of Interdependence."
