# B Corporations
Analyzing B_corps business data from B-labs

## Scope of Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is a personal project created so I can explore, learn about and access B Corporation data.

The aim is to explore similarities and differences between industries and business size as well as longitudinal data to confirm increase in B Corp certifications year over year.

The three questions I wish to address are:
1. What business size are most likely to become B Corps Certified?
2. What trends can be seen by industries/categories becoming certified over the years?
3. Where are BCorps predominantly located?

## Tools Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- PostgreSQL and PGAdmin
- Sci-Kit Learn - Unsupervised Learning 
- Tableau

## What is a B Corp?

<i> "Certified B Corporations are businesses that meet the highest standards of verified social and environmental performance, public transparency, and legal accountability to balance profit and purpose. B Corps are accelerating a global culture shift to redefine success in business and build a more inclusive and sustainable economy.

Societyâ€™s most challenging problems cannot be solved by government and nonprofits alone. The B Corp community works toward reduced inequality, lower levels of poverty, a healthier environment, stronger communities, and the creation of more high quality jobs with dignity and purpose. By harnessing the power of business, B Corps use profits and growth as a means to a greater end: positive impact for their employees, communities, and the environment.

B Corps form a community of leaders and drive a global movement of people using business as a force for good. The values and aspirations of the B Corp community are embedded in the B Corp Declaration of Interdependence."

## Measures of Success
B Corporations must have an overall score of 80 to be listed as a B Corp. The highest score is 200.

From <a href="https://data.world/blab/b-corp-impact-data">data.world</a>:

### Overall Score
A company's overall score is based on their answers to roughly 200 questions. A company begins with zero points and earns points incrementally for each indicator of positive outcome/best practice.

### Impact Area - Governance
The Governance Impact Area evaluates a company's overall mission, ethics, accountability and transparency

### Impact Area - Workers
The Workers Impact Area evaluates the company's contribution to its employees financial, physical, professional, and social well-being

## Analysis

To clean my data, I used a jupyter notebook, pandas and python language. I inspected each column for data quality and evaluated which columns could potentially be problematic for drawing conclusions.

I then established a pipeline through PgAdmin using PostgreSQL to continue querying the data and setting up a database for the ML notebook to pull from.

I performed a KMeans analysis on the data, dividing it into 2 clusters

In a separate notebook I have analyzed the components of each business size. 

I also performed SQL queries to visualize the data.

## Results

To answer the following questions, I have spent some time going through the data


The dataset is composed of certified and decertified businesses.
